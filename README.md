Overview:
Utilizing machine learning, this project offers precise crop recommendations based on environmental factors like N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The goal is to empower farmers with data-driven insights for optimized crop selection.

Approach:

Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed the Kaggle dataset, performing exploratory analysis and outlier detection.
Feature Engineering: Engineered features and transformed data to enhance model performance.
Model Training: Trained multiple algorithms including KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
Model Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy and MSE to select the best-performing algorithm.
Visualization: Generated visualizations for data exploration and model interpretation.
Results:

Best Model: Random Forest achieved highest accuracy (X%) and lowest MSE (Y), offering superior predictive capabilities.
Key Factors: N, P, K, temperature, and rainfall emerged as crucial factors influencing crop recommendations.
Top Recommendations: Provided high-probability crop suggestions like mango, apple, and banana, with additional insights on growth characteristics and harvest methods.
